# Zero Trust Security

Zero Trust Security is a security model that assumes that all users, devices, and applications are potentially compromised and cannot be trusted by default. This repository provides an overview of Zero Trust Security, as well as some best practices and tips for implementing it.

## Key Principles of Zero Trust Security

Zero Trust Security is based on several key principles, including:

1. Verify everything and trust nothing by default.
2. Limit user and device access to only what they need to do their job.
3. Assume all traffic is potentially malicious and inspect it thoroughly.
4. Use strong identity and access controls, such as multi-factor authentication.
5. Segment networks and applications to minimize the impact of a breach.

## Benefits of Zero Trust Security

Zero Trust Security provides several benefits to organizations, including:

1. Enhanced security: Zero Trust Security provides an additional layer of security against cyber threats.
2. Compliance: Zero Trust Security helps organizations meet compliance requirements.
3. Granular control: Zero Trust Security provides granular control over user and device access to systems and applications.
